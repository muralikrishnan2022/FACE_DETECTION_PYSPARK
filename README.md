## Introduction
This project demonstrates the integration of PySpark with OpenCV to perform face detection using a Haar Cascade classifier. The application reads images, detects faces, and saves the results, all within a distributed computing framework provided by PySpark.

## Features
Distributed processing of images using PySpark.
Face detection using Haar Cascade classifier from OpenCV.
Drawing rectangles around detected faces and saving the results.
Displaying the processed image with Matplotlib.

## Technologies Used
PySpark: For distributed data processing.
OpenCV: For image processing and face detection.
Matplotlib: For displaying images.
Python: The programming language used for the project.
